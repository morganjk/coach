####### Machine-readable ontology based on ORION GRADE v1.0

##### TODO / Open questions:

# - Should we use term Asset or Alternative?
# - Should we use term Environment or Context?
# - Are multiple choices allowed for the different value categories (the SGRx)? Yes, and that is probably not an
#   issue in RDF since you can have multiple links of the same name from a node, but could be problematic in Neo4j.
#   The alternatives are either to store the attribute values in an array, or make a node and relation for each value.
#   Since the values are finite, there will be a finite set of nodes which are reused between cases, so maybe the latter 
#   is preferable. 
# - SGR9, SGR15, SGR16, SGR17, SGR20, ESGR9, ESGR10 lack descriptions.
# - How to handle "other" values in selection lists? Predefined categories can be instance nodes, but other values
#   must be a special class, since different instances must be able to hold a description of what the "other" is
#   in each case. So a specific class "Other", and then we need for each concrete instance say that it is
#   both "Other" and the category to which it belongs (e.g. CustomerValue).
