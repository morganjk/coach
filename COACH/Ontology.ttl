####### Machine-readable ontology based on ORION GRADE v1.0

##### TODO / Open questions:

# - Should we use term Asset or Alternative? I prefer Alternative on the top level, since it is more general,
#    and that is how it is currently encoded in this ontology. However, Asset is provided as a subclass of Alternative.
# - Should we use term Environment or Context? Currently, Context is used.
# - Are multiple choices allowed for the different value categories (the SGRx)? Yes, and that is probably not an
#   issue in RDF since you can have multiple links of the same name from a node, but could be problematic in Neo4j.
#   The alternatives are either to store the attribute values in an array, or make a node and relation for each value.
#   Since the values are finite, there will be a finite set of nodes which are reused between cases, so maybe the latter 
#   is preferable. 
# - SGR9, SGR15, SGR16, SGR17, SGR20, ESGR9, ESGR10, RP12, RP19, AT1-6, AT8 lack descriptions.
# - RP16 should be renamed from "Process/Business Analyst" to "Process analyst", or split into two roles.
# - How to handle "other" values in selection lists? Predefined categories can be instance nodes, but other values
#   must be a special class, since different instances must be able to hold a description of what the "other" is
#   in each case. So a specific class "Other", and then we need for each concrete instance say that it is
#   both "Other" and the category to which it belongs (e.g. CustomerValue).
# - The subcategory "Roles" of "Role" in GRADE should be renamed to something more specific. Suggestion: "Role title".
# - The User class needs to be elaborated. Should it build on FOAF? What fields are relevant?
# - RP20-RP22 are identical to RT1-RT3. Only RT1-RT3 are currently included in this ontology.
# - Add suitable restrictions on relations (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)
# - Asset origin options/suboption should be refined. They overlap now. In particular regarding "open source", but also
#   for some other data.
# - Why is AO4 mentioning "government contract" in the definition field?
# - The properties part of Asset seems to be placed in a rather strange place. Shouldn't it be in Goals, or perhaps Decisions?
# - The top level of GRADE is quite generic. Maybe there should be a subclass for each of the top elements, that are used
#   for the specific decision problem of selecting software components? This is how Alternative vs. Asset are handled now,
#   but the same principle could be applied for the other categories as well.
# - The elements SGR15 and SGR16 appear as both "customer value" and "internal business value". This does not make much sense.
#   It should be only "customer value".
# - The different classes defined should have :title and :description fields.
# - The class User should probably be called Person, and be a subclass of foaf:Person.
# - Use FunctionalProperty to indicate properties that can only have one value for a certain subject.


##### Missing parts:
# - Asset properties, needs to clarified how properties should be handled in general, and how to align with the property model work.
# - Decision, not started yet.
# - Environment/Context. Started with the organization subcategory. Current idea is to use the Context model, since it is more mature,
#   and skip the Environment part of GRADE.

# An Alternative is specialized by Asset, which is the kind of alternatives considered in the ORION project.
# An Asset links to asset usage; origin options and suboptions; and element types. 
# In GRADE, there is also a link to properties, which is currently not represented in this ontology.
