####### Machine-readable ontology based on ORION GRADE v1.0

##### TODO / Open questions:

# - Should we use term Asset or Alternative? I prefer Alternative on the top level, since it is more general,
#    and that is how it is currently encoded in this ontology. However, Asset is provided as a subclass of Alternative.
# - Should we use term Environment or Context?
# - Are multiple choices allowed for the different value categories (the SGRx)? Yes, and that is probably not an
#   issue in RDF since you can have multiple links of the same name from a node, but could be problematic in Neo4j.
#   The alternatives are either to store the attribute values in an array, or make a node and relation for each value.
#   Since the values are finite, there will be a finite set of nodes which are reused between cases, so maybe the latter 
#   is preferable. 
# - SGR9, SGR15, SGR16, SGR17, SGR20, ESGR9, ESGR10, RP12, RP19, AT1-6, AT8 lack descriptions.
# - RP16 should be renamed from "Process/Business Analyst" to "Process analyst", or split into two roles.
# - How to handle "other" values in selection lists? Predefined categories can be instance nodes, but other values
#   must be a special class, since different instances must be able to hold a description of what the "other" is
#   in each case. So a specific class "Other", and then we need for each concrete instance say that it is
#   both "Other" and the category to which it belongs (e.g. CustomerValue).
# - The subcategory "Roles" of "Role" in GRADE should be renamed to something more specific. Suggestion: "Role title".
# - The User class needs to be elaborated. Should it build on FOAF?
# - RP20-RP22 are identical to RT1-RT3. Only RT1-RT3 are currently included in this ontology.
# - Add suitable restrictions on relations (such as one-to-one, one-to-many, etc.)
# - Asset origin options/suboption should be refined. They overlap now. In particular regarding "open source", but also
#   for some other data.
# - Why is AO4 mentioning "government contract" in the definition field?
# - The properties part of Asset seems to be placed in a rather strange place. Shouldn't it be in Goals, or perhaps Decisions?

##### Missing parts:
# - Asset properties, needs to clarified how properties should be handled in general, and how to align with the property model work.
# - Decision, not started yet.
# - Environment/Context, not started yet. Alignment needed.
